# Web Development Automation with Gulp

_A presentation on using [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to automate certain web development tasks_

This was a presentation that I gave on 10/25/2016 to a user group at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu).

### Viewing Options

- View it [online](https://wunc.github.io/gulp-presentation)
- Clone/download this repository, then open the presentation/index.html file in your browser.
- Open the [gulp.pdf](gulp.pdf).

If viewing in your browser, note that you can navigate using the arrow keys. Some slides have sub-slides that are meant to be accessed with the down-arrow key. The `package.json` and `gulpfile.js` are included; so you can actually follow along and try out Gulp yourself! This presentation was built using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
